##### Professional Summary
As a Research Psychologist at the Naval Submarine Medical Research Laboratory and a Doctoral Candidate in the Industrial-Organizational Psychology PhD program at the University at Albany, State University of New York, my work focuses on training evaluation, assessment development, leadership assessment, and work motivation. I currently work on applied projects to implement a leadership development program, evaluate and build person-environment fit, and develop and validate core leadership competencies. I am currently researching the influence that a mindfulness practice has in a formal training setting, how psychological need satisfaction at home and work interaction to influence work recovery, and the causal role that autonomous motivation plays in the association between psychological need satisfaction and burnout.
