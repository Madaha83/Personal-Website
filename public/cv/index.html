<p>As a Research Psychologist at the Naval Submarine Medical Research Laboratory, I specialize in training evaluation, assessment development and validation, leadership assessment and development, and work motivation. My current role involves leading applied projects that implement leadership development programs, evaluate and enhance person-environment fit, and develop and validate assessments of core leadership competencies. My research focuses on the intersection of psychological need satisfaction at home and work, exploring how this interaction influences work recovery, well-being, motivation, and burnout. Through my work, I aim to apply theoretically driven, empirically tested, and data-informed practices to advance the readiness and effectiveness of the undersea warfighter community.</p>
