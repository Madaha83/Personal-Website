      <description>Professional Summary As a Research Psychologist at the Naval Submarine Medical Research Laboratory and a Doctoral Candidate in the Industrial-Organizational Psychology PhD program at the University at Albany, State University of New York, my work focuses on training evaluation, assessment development, leadership assessment, and work motivation.
